# Booky: I'm learning nodejs parce que je le vaux bien (tu pux pas test)

This is a personal project with only one goal: learning nodejs.

It's based on [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework and lesson on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)

Right now I don't do a lot, just try to find book information based on its ISBN. All "isbn" lib I tested are not really great and most of the
time failed with French book.

#### To do:

- [ ] add documentation, built from sphinx
- [ ] find a isbn lib that works with french books. Try asking to "storit" team how they do it. Everything I tried are not really powerful and most of the time failed to find result

#### Various:

- On ubuntu node vs. nodejs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21168141/cannot-install-packages-using-node-package-manager-in-ubuntu
- optional package fevents (exist only on MacOS). How to not trying to install it? I suppose this package comes with nodemon, should check
