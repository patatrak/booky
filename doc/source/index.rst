What is booky?
##############

Building booky
##############

What you need?
==============
- nodejs: to code the app :)
- sphinx: to build this documentation

Where to build?
===============

Everywhere nodejs exist you should be capable of buildig the app. I personnaly build
on a Ubuntu 17.04. Before to add this sphinx documentation I was also building on Windows 10
but I didn't try to setup sphinx on W10. So I must try.
